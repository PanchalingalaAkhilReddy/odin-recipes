# odin-recipes
This is my first HTML project for The Odin Project Foundations course.  
Itâ€™s a simple recipe website built using semantic HTML and internal linking.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cloning a GitHub repo using SSH
- Navigating file structure and using `cd` in terminal
- Writing semantic HTML with headings, lists, and links
- Organizing a multi-page site with proper folder structure
- Practicing Git version control and meaningful commit messages

## Reflection
This project helped reinforce my understanding of HTML structure and Git workflows.  
I now feel more confident creating and managing web projects from scratch.
